        <p>
            Welcome to Swipe4Paws! We’re a group of students from SDU in Sønderborg,
             bringing together animal shelters across Denmark to help people find 
             their ideal pets with ease. Inspired by dating apps, we created a swipe
              feature that lets you explore and match with animals looking for a 
              loving home.

        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>          
            We connect people with animals in need, making adoption fun and simple. 
            Every profile brings you closer to a potential companion, and every 
            swipe supports shelters across Denmark.

        <h1>Our Unique Swipe Feature
        </h1>
        <p>
            Finding the perfect pet should be as easy and enjoyable as meeting 
            a new friend. That’s why we designed a swipe feature, inspired by
             popular dating apps, that lets you explore pets at a glance. Swipe 
             right to show interest in a pet, and swipe left to view other profiles. 
             Each animal’s profile includes photos, personality details, and shelter
              information, so you can quickly get to know them.
